# Virtual Hand Gesture Calculator

A touchless, gesture-controlled calculator built with **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**.  
This project allows users to perform calculations (basic and scientific) by pinching their **thumb** and **index finger** over a virtual button interface — no mouse or keyboard required.
